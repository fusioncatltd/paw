# When asked to implement a new CLI command

* First configure the command in @router file first. Add all the approproate flags and arguments.
* Then implement the command in @actions folder. Create a new file for a new action.
* When implementing the command,  follow the existing structure of commands and flags which already exists
in @router file.
* Most of the time you will need to make API calls from the command. Check @client code for the API
calls, they should be there.
* After implementing the command, you will need to write a test for it. Check @tests folder for the existing tests 
and follow the rules for writing tests.
