# How to write a test

* Despite the best practices, don't create any moks in code. We will be always testing a real implementation with 
all services involved.
* The behaviour of CLI tool depends on the environment variables (for example, the hostname of API server). Because
of that, every file with test case must be using the env variables stored in `.env` file. These parameters can be
always ascquired via `if err := godotenv.Load(".env"); err != nil {
  t.Fatalf("Error loading .env file: %v", err)
  }` code snippet.
* The reference implementation of the test case is always the same and it can be found in @signup_signing_test.go file.
Please try to keep other implementations as close to this one as possible unless there are clear instructions
to do otherwise.
* Every test case must implement all steps required to test entire use case, always including signup.
